    <h2>Tea is a drink of health</h2>
    <center><p class="second-title">& beauty for you</p></center>
    <center><p>Ceylon tea is an outstanding source of antioxidants compounds that help counteract oxidative cell harm.
      Analysis shows that antioxidants play a key role in wellbeing and can guard against chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiac disease.
      In specific, Ceylon tea is abundant in myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol antioxidants.
      
      Green Ceylon tea contains epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a compound that has demonstrated good health-promoting effects in human and test tube trials.
      
      Both Ceylon tea varieties have a small amount of caffeine and some trace minerals, including manganese, cobalt , chromium and magnesium. </p></center>

      <h3>What Is Ceylon Tea?</h3>  
      <p>Ceylon tea refers to tea produced in the Sri Lankan highlands, formerly named Ceylon.
        Like other types of tea, Camellia sinensis consists of dried and refined tea plant leaves.
        However, some antioxidants, including myricetine, quercetine and kaempferol can contain an increase in the concentration of the substance.
        
        There is also a small variation in flavour. The citrus notes and full-bodied flavor of the tea are due to the excellent climate in which they are produced.
        
        It is normally available in 
        <ul class="a">
          <li>oolong</li><br>
          <li>green</li><br>
          <li>black</li><br>
          <li>white</li>&nbsp;Ceylon varieties — which differ based on specific processing and production methods.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>May Help Stabilize Blood Sugar</h3>  
        <p>High blood sugar can have several adverse effects on 
          <ol>
            <li>health</li><br>
            <li>including weight loss</li><br>
            <li>fatigue</li>&nbsp;and delayed wound healing.<br>
          </ol> 


          Research indicates that it can help keep blood glucous levels stable and avoid harmful side effects by adding certain kinds of ceylon tea to your everyday routine.<br>
For example, a small study in 24 individuals found that consuming black tea could decrease the levels of blood sugar dramatically in individuals with and without prediabetes.<br>
Likewise, an exhaustive study of 17 researchers found green tea to be effective at lowering blood sugar and insulin levels a blood sugar hormone.<br>

Moreover, other studies have shown a reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes in daily tea use.</p>

        <h3>May Support Heart Health</h3>  
        <p>The major concern of heart problems is estimated to account for 31.5% of deaths around the world.<br>
          Some forms of ceylon tea can minimize heart disease risk factors and improve heart health.<br>
          In fact, several studies have shown that green tea and its components can decrease total cholesterol and LDL (bad) as well as triglyceride — a type of fat in the blood.<br>
          A analysis also found that black tea in high-level individuals has been able to lower levels of both overall and LDL ( bad) cholesterol.<br>
          Nevertheless further testing is required because the effects of black tea on cholesterol levels were not found in other trials.</p>

        <h3>Potential Side Effects</h3>  
        <p>When drunk in moderation, ceylon tea can be a safe and nutritious addition to the diet.<br>
          However, depending on the kind of tea it contains between 14-61 mg caffeine per serving.<br>
          Caffeine not only addicts but also has adverse consequences such as nausea, sleeplessness, hypertension and stomach disorders.<br>
It is advised to restrict the consumption of caffeine to less than 200 mg a day for pregnant women as the drug will cross the placehold and increase the risk of error or low weight at birth.<br>
Caffeine can also interfere with certain drugs, including hypertension , heart disorders, stimulants, and certain antibiotics.<br>

Ceylon tea in caffeine is also significantly smaller than drinks such as chocolate, but it is a perfect choice for those who are hunting for coffeine.<br>

However, only a few portions a day are better held to reduce the chance of adverse effects. Be sure the doctor consults if you are worried.</p>
