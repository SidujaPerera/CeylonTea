    <h4>Black Tea</h4>
    <p>The difference among each tea is the amount of oxidation or fermentation of the leaves. The highly oxidized tea leaves are typically darker or redder, while the less fermented teas are lighter or greener. Caffeine is commonly found in conventional tea.<br>

      Fruit and herbal teas vary from conventional teas. Caffeine is less common in these varieties. They are made from dried herbs or berries, as you might guess from their name. Different herbs can provide a range of health benefits, but the jury decides what benefits you can gain from consuming herbal tea.<br>
      
      The following are some of the most common herbal and traditional forms of tea. Tea 's nutritional advantages and empirical data that may confirm the arguments are highlighted.</p>

    <h4>Green Tea</h4>
    <p>Green tea is one of the most popular teas on the market because of its popularity for antioxidants and health enhancement. Also popular with healthy food shops and fitness groups is Matcha or powdered green tea. Powdered tea is a loose tea consisting of green tea leaves as well. A cup of matcha tea, according to some reports, provides 10 cups of green tea, which are frequently brewed.<br>

      The possible health effects of green tea and green tea derivatives is extensively researched. However, according to the national health institutes, only some of these advantages are backed by empirical data.<br>

      There is only scant evidence that tea does have some anti-cancer effects according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Integrative Medicine Database.<br>

      ﻿ And there were mixed findings from some research. This refers to the potential effects of green tea on heart disease and cholesterol.<br>

      Green tea could be able to avoid tooth decay, but in clinical trials the hypothesis was not evaluated. Any tests have found you can reduce the chance of high blood pressure with drinking green tea.<br>

      Caffeine in green tea can improve mental control of the nervous system and can influence metabolism (limited).

Nausea and stomach upset can be part of the side effects of consuming green tea in some individuals. In green tea caffeine can also induce nervousness and sleeping disturbances.</p>

    <h4>Orange Tea</h4>
    <p>The effective and positive health advantages connected to orange tea are believed to be quite potent. The benefits are primarily derived from the various tea components as well as its orange fruit and juice components.<br>

      Orange tea is the term used to refer to a type of flavored tea that is made up typically of a black tea base that has been infused with orange flavor (usually from orange juice), and garnished with dried orange pieces and orange peel. Orange tea has a citrusy aroma and has a slightly tangy taste.<br>

      The orange is a citrus fruit with finely-textured skins whose thickness differs according to the variety. The fruit has a pulpy and juicy flesh. The diameter of the orange fruit typically ranges from two to three inches.<br>

      Orange tea benefits can be derived and enjoyed through these methods:<br>

      Simply place about a teaspoon of ready-made loose leaf orange tea in a cup or mug of newly-boiled water and allow to steep for about 3 to 4 minutes. Discard the leaves and then drink. To sweeten the tea, add a hint of honey or sugar.<br>
    Dunk one orange teabag into a mug of newly-boiled water and allow to steep for about 3 to 4 minutes. Discard the teabag and then drink.</p>
